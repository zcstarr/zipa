## Data

All data are distributed in the scalable `shar` format, similar to `webdataset` format but with indexes. It can be easily loaded with `lhotse` library. Audio files are downsampled to 16000Hz and stored in the `flac` format to save space. 

 - [All processed data](https://huggingface.co/collections/anyspeech/ipapack-raw-673c2d345deec72e82e28a3b) (~1.8TB)
 - [Training data only](https://huggingface.co/collections/anyspeech/ipa-pack-train-6838a6804a3a71a91794a801) (~1.5TB)
